On March 19th and 20th, 2024 CIFARâ€™s
[Data Communities for Inclusion Solution Network](https://cifar.ca/ai/ai-and-society/cifar-solution-networks/data-communities-for-inclusion/)
held a workshop in London, UK titled Building Solidarity on Community-led Data Governance.
This intimate workshop brought together members of the Solution Network with thought leaders,
technologists, and policymakers from diverse areas of expertise including cooperative
development, socio-technological design, social inclusion, data governance, and more.
Through presentations, activities and in-depth discussions, the group examined community-led
ways of creating, using, and governing data and artificial intelligence technologies.
The workshop was also an opportunity for participants to develop relationships, extend
their networks, and continue the conversation into the future.
