The [IDRC Inverted Wordles](https://inverted-wordles.netlify.app/) website has been enhanced to provide
bilingual support, offering both English and French language options. This update aims to cater to a broader
range of users and improve accessibility for individuals who prefer either of these languages.

By implementing bilingual support, the website now offers a more inclusive experience, ensuring that users can
interact with the website in their preferred language. This enhancement not only promotes better engagement
but also aligns with the organization's commitment to diversity and inclusivity.

The addition of French language support is a significant step towards expanding the reach of the Inverted Wordles
platform. With this feature in place, further language support can be easily incorporated by adding translations
and making minor adjustments, allowing for future growth and adaptation to diverse linguistic communities.

We encourage users to explore the bilingual features and provide feedback on their experience. Continuous
improvement and adaptation to user needs remain a top priority, ensuring that the platform remains accessible and
engaging for a wide range of individuals.
