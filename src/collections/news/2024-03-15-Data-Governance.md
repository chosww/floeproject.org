The
[Data Communities for Inclusion Network](https://cifar.ca/ai/ai-and-society/cifar-solution-networks/data-communities-for-inclusion/)
has recently launched our open-access
[Community Governance Toolkit](https://datacommunities.ca/),
which provides a growing collection of resources and case studies related to cooperative
and inclusive approaches to data governance that advocate for grassroots leadership
of emerging technologies. We invite contributions to the toolkit through the sharing
of relevant resources on the topic of worker ownership and community-led design and
governance of data technologies. The Solution Network is looking to build relationships
across communities globally, to connect and integrate the toolkit with other related
efforts, ensuring it meets the diverse needs of community-led justice and solidarity
movements and promotes broader engagement and implementation. Please feel free to share
[the toolkit](https://datacommunities.ca/)
with your network.
